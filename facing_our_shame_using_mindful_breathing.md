# Facing our shame using mindful breathing  

To face our shame, we lie on our backs, close our eyes, and focus on deep breathing.  

**How it works:** We used to use entertainment to run away from our shame and became addicted. Once we started using mindful breathing, though, we developed the mental clarity to face our shame.
