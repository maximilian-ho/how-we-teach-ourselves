# How to focus on solving social issues  

**Let go of competing:**   
We frequently remind ourselves that life isn't a competition for social status. It's a team effort to solve social issues.    

**Reduce our consumption of entertainment:**   
Whenever we lack motivation, we set a three-minute timer, during which we must work.    

**Overcome regret:**   
To overcome regret, we focus on helping others to avoid the mistakes we made (without being condescending).
