# Change what it means to win 

If our definition of winning is being superior to others, then everyone loses, because we put down others. We see life as a competition for a limited amount of opportunities.

Meanwhile, if our definition of winning is improving society, then everyone wins, because we empower others. We see life as a team effort to innovate more opportunities.
