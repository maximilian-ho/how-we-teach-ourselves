# Change what it means to win 

If our definition of winning is being superior to others, then everyone loses, because we want others to be worse than us. This definition causes us to see life as a competition and put down others. 
 
Meanwhile, if our definition of winning is improving society, then everyone wins, because we want others to surpass us. This definition causes us to see life as a team effort and empower others.

It's unlucky that destructive desires are wired into our brains. Hence, we must develop rational thinking to overcome these desires, such as by reading books on social issues.
