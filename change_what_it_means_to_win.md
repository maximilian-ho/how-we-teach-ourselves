# Change what it means to win 

If our definition of winning is being number 1, then everyone loses, because everyone feels jealous of the success of others. This mindset causes us to see everyone as competition, and makes us put down others. 
 
Meanwhile, if our definition of winning is improving society, then everyone can win, because everyone can contribute to society. This mindset causes us to see everyone as collaborators, and makes us empower others.

It's unlucky that the instinct to compete is wired into our brains. But we can develop rational thinking to overcome our destructive instincts, such as by reading books on social issues.
