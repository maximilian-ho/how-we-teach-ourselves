# Change what it means to win 

If our definition of winning is being superior to others, then everyone loses, because we feel inferior when others succeed. This mindset causes us to see everyone as competition, and makes us put down others. 
 
Meanwhile, if our definition of winning is improving society, then everyone can win, because everyone can contribute to society. This mindset causes us to see everyone as collaborators, and makes us empower others.

It's unlucky that destructive instincts are wired into our brains. Hence, we must develop rational thinking to overcome these instincts, such as by reading books on social issues.
