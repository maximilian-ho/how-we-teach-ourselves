# Staying focused by meditating  

To stay focused, we lie on our backs, close our eyes, and focus on deep breathing.  

**How it works:** We used to use entertainment to run away from our shame, which only caused more shame. Once we started meditating, we obtained the mental clarity to face our shame.
