# Reading epub ebooks using Moon+ Reader

We constantly read books on technology, tech company management, and poverty.   

**Downloading the books**   
We download the epub books from LibGen.  

**Reading on our phones**   
We read the books on our phones using Moon+ reader. Instead of reading in a linear order, we jump between different sections, and also jump between books. This helps us to constantly review the ideas in our favorite books.  

The screenshots below show the contents (left image) and bookmarks (right image) of a book in Moon+ reader.

**Adding bookmarks using Calibre**  
To make the books easy to navigate, they must have comprehensive bookmarks. Since most epub books from LibGen have incomplete bookmarks, we add them ourselves using Calibre editor. Calibre can automatically generate the bookmarks given the HTML tag and class attribute of each chapter level. In the book shown below, the 2nd chapter level has the HTML tag "h1" and the class attribute "sect1c".

**Customizing Moon+ reader**  
We use Moon+ reader because it's highly customizable. We recommend using the settings in the screenshots below.

“Disable CSS styles” (left image) standardizes the font settings for all books. Meanwhile, setting the “Left to Right” finger gesture to “Show Chapters” (right image) allows us to quickly access the bookmarks for each book.
