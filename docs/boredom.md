# Training our boredom muscles

We used to be addicted to entertainment and wasted a lot of time consuming it. Fortunately, after reading some productivity books, we finally realized that our problem was our weak "boredom muscles". This was because we were consuming entertainment whenever we felt even a little bored. Hence, just like we train our physical muscles by regularly exercising, we began training our boredom muscles by regularly being bored. We're glad that we finally overcame our addiction.
