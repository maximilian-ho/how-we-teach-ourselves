# Developing our boredom muscles

We used to be addicted to entertainment and wasted a lot of time consuming it. Fortunately, after reading some productivity books, we finally realized that our problem was our weak "boredom muscles". Because we had developed a habit of consuming entertainment whenever we felt even a little bored, we hadn't used our "boredom muscles" for a long time. Hence, just like we slowly developed our cardiovascular muscles by regularly running, we slowly developed our boredom muscles by regularly being bored. We're glad that we finally overcame our addiction.
