# Developing our boredom muscles

We used to be addicted to entertainment and wasted a lot of time consuming it. Fortunately, after reading some productivity books, we finally realized that our problem was our weak "boredom muscles". We had developed a habit of consuming entertainment whenever we felt even a little bored so we had never truly used our boredom muscles. Hence, just like we slowly developed our physical muscles by regularly exercising, we slowly developed our boredom muscles by regularly being bored. We're glad that we finally overcame our addiction.
