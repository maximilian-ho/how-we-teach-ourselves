# Annotating pdf textbooks using Foxit pdf editor 

Textbooks can be very complex and overwhelming. Hence, when learning from pdf textbooks, we type our notes directly onto the pages. This helps us to process the concepts one step at a time, and understand the text when we review it later.

**Editing bookmarks using a code editor**  
To add a bookmark for a location on a page, we press “ctrl + b”. Most textbooks have bookmarks with unnecessary prefixes and too many levels. Hence, we export the bookmarks as an XML file and use a code editor to edit them using regular expressions. This is much faster than editing the bookmarks manually.

**Typing notes**  
In the example below, we annotated the graphs to make them easier to understand.

**Adding equations**  
Currently, we cannot type equations in Foxit pdf editor. Hence, we type our equations in Microsoft Word. After that, we use the Snipping Tool to copy an image of the equation, then paste the image onto the page.

The images below show the old bookmarks (left image) and the improved bookmarks (right image).

**Making space**  
When there is no space on a page to add a note, we make space by deleting headers and footers, and moving the page’s contents. If there still isn’t enough space, we duplicate the page, then divide the page’s contents onto two pages. This creates plenty of empty space that we crop out after adding our notes.
