# Focusing on listening 
Whenever we communicate with others, we focus on listening. 

**How it works:** We used to be terrible listeners because we were too focused on being the hero that solves the problem. Meanwhile, when we focus on listening, we gave others the chance to be the hero. When we have advice to share, instead of imposing it on others, we post it online so that they can look it up themselves.
