# Focusing on listening 
Whenever we communicate with others, we focus on listening. Instead of giving unsolicited advice, we post it online so that others can look it up themselves.  

**How it works:** We used to be terrible listeners, which made others feel disrespected. Meanwhile, when we focus on listening, we help others feel understood.
