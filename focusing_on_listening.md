# Focusing on listening 
Whenever we communicate with others, we focus on listening. 

**How it works:** We used to be terrible listeners because we were too focused on being the hero that solves the problem. Meanwhile, when we focus on listening, we give others the chance to be the hero. Instead of giving unsolicited advice, we post it online so that others can look it up themselves.
