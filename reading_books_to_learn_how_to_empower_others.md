# Reading books to learn how to empower others

We continuously read books on management and social issues to learn how to empower others.  

**Downloading the books**   
We download the epub books from LibGen.  

**Reading on our phones**   
We read these books on our phones using Moon+ reader. Whenever we feel like reading, we open Moon+ reader and read for a few minutes. Instead of reading in a linear order, we jump between different sections, and also jump between books. This allows us to constantly review the ideas so that we don't forget them.  

The screenshots below show the contents (left image) and bookmarks (right image) of a book in Moon+ reader.

**Adding bookmarks using Calibre**  
To make the books easy to navigate, they must have comprehensive bookmarks. Since most epub books have incomplete bookmarks, we add them ourselves using Calibre editor. To do so, we need to identify the HTML tag and class attribute of each chapter title and subsection title. For example, in the image below, the HTML tag of the subsection title is "p" and its class attribute is "h22".

**Customizing Moon+ reader**  
We use Moon+ reader because it's highly customizable. We recommend using the settings in the screenshots below.

“Disable CSS styles” (left image) standardizes the font settings for all books. Meanwhile, setting the “Left to Right” finger gesture to “Show Chapters” (right image) allows us to quickly access the bookmarks for each book.
