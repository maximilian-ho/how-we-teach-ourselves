# Focus on solving social issues  

**How to stop competing:** Life isn't a competition for social status. It's a team effort to solve social issues.    

**How to reduce our consumption of entertainment:** Whenever we lack motivation, we set a three-minute timer, during which we must work.    

**How to overcome regret:** We focus on helping others to avoid the mistakes we made (without being condescending).
