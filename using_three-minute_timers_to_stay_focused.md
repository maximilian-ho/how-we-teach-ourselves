# Using three-minute timers to stay focused  

We continuously set three-minute timers, during which we must work. The short time intervals help us to stay focused.  


**How it works:** Whenever we take a break, we dread getting back to work. The three-minute timer reduces this dread because we only need to focus for three minutes.
