# Using three-minute timers to stay focused  

We continuously set three-minute timers, during which we must work. The short time intervals help us to stay focused.  

The procedure is:  
**1.** Set a silent three-minute timer   
**2.** Work until the timer goes off    
**3.** If we want to continue working, we set another three-minute timer. Else, we take a break.   

**How it works:** The most difficult part of working is getting started because we often dread all the work we need to complete. The three-minute timer reduces this dread because we only need to focus for three minutes.
