# Using three-minute timers to stay focused  

We continuously set three-minute timers, during which we must work. The short time intervals help us to stay focused. After each three-minute interval, we can either set a new timer or take a break, depending on how motivated we feel.

**How it works:** The most difficult part of working is getting started because we often dread all the work we need to complete. The three-minute timer reduces this dread because we only need to focus for three minutes, after which we're allowed to take a break. Most of the time, though, we want to continue working because by getting started we gain momentum.
