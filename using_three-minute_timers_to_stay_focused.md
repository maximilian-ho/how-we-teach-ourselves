# Using three-minute timers to stay focused  

We continuously set three-minute timers, during which we must work. The short time intervals help us to stay focused.

**How it works:** The most difficult part of working is getting started because we often dread all the work we need to complete. The three-minute timer makes it easy to start working because we only need to focus for three minutes.
