We obtain epub and pdf files from a shadow library. The key idea behind all these techniques is to make the learning materials easier to navigate. This helps us to quickly jump between different sections, which makes learning more fun.

We don’t claim that these techniques are the best for everyone, only that they work for us. We wish to share them in case they help anyone. Furthermore, we continue to update our learning techniques as we learn from others.

## 1. Read epub books using Moon+ reader
We enjoy reading books on social issues. They remind us to leave no one behind. To read these books, we use Moon+ reader on our phones.

The screenshots below show the contents (left image) and bookmarks (right image) of a book in Moon+ reader.

**Adding bookmarks using Calibre**
To make the books easy to navigate, it’s crucial that they have comprehensive bookmarks. Since most epub books have incomplete bookmarks, we add them ourselves using Calibre editor. To do so, we need to identify the heading tag and class attribute of each chapter title and subsection title.

“Disable CSS styles” (left image) standardizes the font settings for all books. Meanwhile, setting the “Left to Right” finger gesture to “Show Chapters” (right image) allows us to quickly access the bookmarks.

## 2. Annotate pdf textbooks using Foxit pdf editor
