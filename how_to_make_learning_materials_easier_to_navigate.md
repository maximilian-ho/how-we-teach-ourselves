# How to make learning materials easier to navigate

The three learning techniques we recommend in this article are:  
**1. Organize online articles using Microsoft Word**  
**2. Read epub books using Moon+ reader**  
**3. Annotate pdf textbooks using Foxit pdf editor**

The key idea behind all these techniques is to make the learning materials easier to navigate. This helps us to quickly jump between different sections.

We don’t claim that these techniques are the best for everyone, only that they work for us. We wish to share them in case they help anyone. Furthermore, we continue to update our learning techniques as we learn from others.

## 1. Organize online articles using Microsoft Word
We organize links to useful online articles in one Word document.

## 2. Read epub books using Moon+ reader
We read books on social issues using Moon+ reader on our phones.

The screenshots below show the contents (left image) and bookmarks (right image) of a book in Moon+ reader.

**Adding bookmarks using Calibre**  
To make the books easy to navigate, it’s crucial that they have comprehensive bookmarks. Since most epub books have incomplete bookmarks, we add them ourselves using Calibre editor. To do so, we need to identify the heading tag and class attribute of each chapter title and subsection title.

**Customizing Moon+ reader**  
Moon+ reader is highly customizable. We recommend using the settings in the screenshots below.

“Disable CSS styles” (left image) standardizes the font settings for all books. Meanwhile, setting the “Left to Right” finger gesture to “Show Chapters” (right image) allows us to quickly access the bookmarks.

## 3. Annotate pdf textbooks using Foxit pdf editor
Textbooks can be very complex and overwhelming. Hence, when learning from pdf textbooks, we type our notes directly onto the pages. This helps us to process the concepts one step at a time, and understand the text when we review it later.

**Editing bookmarks using a code editor**  
To add a bookmark for a location on a page, we press “ctrl + b”. Most textbooks have bookmarks with unnecessary prefixes and too many levels. Hence, we export the bookmarks as an XML file and use a code editor to edit them using regular expressions. This is much faster than editing the bookmarks manually.

**Typing notes**  
In the example below, we annotated the graphs to make them easier to understand.

**Adding equations**  
Currently, we cannot type equations in Foxit pdf editor. Hence, we type our equations in Microsoft Word. After that, we use the Snipping Tool to copy an image of the equation, then paste the image onto the page.

**Making space**  
When there is no space on a page to add a note, we make space by deleting headers and footers, and moving the page’s contents. If there still isn’t enough space, we duplicate the page, then divide the page’s contents onto two pages. This creates plenty of empty space that we crop out after adding our notes.
